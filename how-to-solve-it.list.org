* How to solve it
** Understanding The Problem
You have to understand the problem.

- What is the unknown? 
- What are the data? 
- What is the condition?
- Is it possible to satisfy the condition? 
- Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?
- Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Or contradictary?
- Draw a figure. 
- Introduce suitable notation.
- Separate the various parts of the condition.
- Can you write them down?


** Devising A Plan
 Find the connection between the data and the unknown. You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found. You should obtain eventually a plan of the solution.
 
 
- Have you seen it before?
- Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?
- Do you know a related problem?
- Do you know a theorem that could be useful?
- Look at the unknown!
- And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.
- Where is a problem related to yours and solved before.
- Could you use it?
- Could you use its result?
- Could you use its method?
- Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?
- Could you restate the problem?
- Could you restate it still differently? 
- Go back to definitions.
- If you can not solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem.
- Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?
- A more general problem?
- A more special problem?
- An analogous problem?
- Could you solve a part of the problem?
- Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part; how far is the unknown then determined, how can it vary?
- Could you derive something useful from the data?
- Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown?
- Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
- Did you use all the data?
- Did you use the whole condition?
- Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem?
 
 
** Carrying Out The Plan
  Carry out your plan.

- Carrying out your plan of the solution, check each step.
- Can you see clearly that the step is correct?
- Can you prove that it is correct?
  
  
** Looking Back
  Examine the solution obtained.
  
- Can you check the result?
- Can you check the argument?
- Can you derite the result diffcrcntly?
- Can you see it a it at glance?
- Can you use the result, or the method, for some other prohlum?
